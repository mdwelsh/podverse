    description: >-
      There’s a reason the History Channel has produced hundreds of
      documentaries about Hitler but only a few about Dwight D. Eisenhower. Bad
      guys (and gals) are eternally fascinating. Behind the Bastards dives in
      past the Cliffs Notes of the worst humans in history and exposes the
      bizarre realities of their lives. Listeners will learn about the young
      adult novels that helped Hitler form his monstrous ideology, the founder
      of Blackwater’s insane quest to build his own Air Force, the bizarre lives
      of the sons and daughters of dictators and Saddam Hussein’s side career as
      a trashy romance novelist.
